## Background

Our goal is to find a ground-via placement strategy to achieve the best Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) mitigation for a specified number of ground vias.More details can be found in our paper.

> An example is implemented in the code, which selects 10 positions to place vias from 100 positions to minimize *H<sub>out</sub>* . 

## Demo

> Demo of placing vias yourself.
